# Database
Custom database project by Andrew and Fiona.

Currently in progress.

Note that git commit history is not representative of the work distribution, as the majority of the work is done in VSCode Live Share sessions of both of us working on it simultaneously.

Required external libraries:
Botan 3

TO compile and run:
```
make
./build/database
```

To test, run:
```
make test
```

Then go through every executable in `build/tests`
